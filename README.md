# HuntingRL

A prototype game built primarily to test skills in creating a larger project by myself.  HuntingRL is an open-world,
modern wild game hunting themed ASCII-based game inspired by ascii roguelikes.

### Main gameplay loop?

You step out of your truck.  Only a handful of money in your pocket, an old hand-me-down bolt action rifle in your hands with
a single box of 20 hand-loaded bullets as your only means of surviving and making a living.  You walk into the woods along with a backpack
full of snacks and water.  As you take each step, you notice how strenous this is -- those snacks and water likely aren't even enough to 
last you a weekend.

You notice deer sign fairly quickly.  Not fresh, but not too old either.  Setting up on a ridge overlooking the area where you saw the
sign, you begin to wait.  Paying attention, looking around, is more difficult than you thought.

3 hours in, you hear a sound to your right.  You look closely, heartbeat spiking.  It's a squirrel.  Not what you're here for.  You sigh.

Near the end of the day, you spot movement 70 yards away.  A young buck steps into the clearing, quartered slightly away from you.  4
points on the left antler, 4 on the right, you count.  Barely legal in this county, but you're not picky. You slowly pick up your rifle.
You begin to aim.  The deer is moving, so you decide to wait until it stops.  Your heartbeat is deafening.  You keep the rifle trained
right behind the shoulder, a few inches back to account for less-than-perfect the shooting angle.  It stops for a second, bending down to
browse on a small clover patch.  You pull the trigger, BANG.  The sound echoes through the forest.  You see the buck flinch for a second
from the impact, before clumsily jumping towards the northwest into the forest.

A few minutes later, you gather yourself up and walk towards the spot where you shot him.  A small blood pool trailing northwest is
there. Tracking is very easy here as it's still early season and the leaves haven't turned that blood-red color yet.  30 yards away lies
the buck, collapsed motionless in a heap in a small clearing. 

Now, the real work begins.

You gut the buck, keeping the heart and liver.  Grabbing the antlers, you begin dragging the deer back towards your truck.  It's
exhausting work, but by nightfall you've hoisted the carcass in the bed of your truck.  So far, so good.

Driving back to your cabin, you cut the carcass into pieces just like you remember learning, and decide on your strategy for handling
the meat. You have a chest freezer that will easily fit all the meat chunks whole.  The high quality cuts, the loins, you save to roast
whole.  All the rest, you bone out and cut into chunks.  You don't own a grinder yet, but you can send it in to your butcher to make
sausages.  You can sell the hide to your local taxidermist.  You cut the antlers off and mount them -- a memento of your first
successful hunt here.

With meat in your freezer, you finally receive the fruits of your labor, and reflect on your experience.  What went well?  What do you
need to improve on?  Eating the meat will make you stronger, faster, more dextrous.  Selling the meat will give you money to buy new
tools to make this job more efficient and allow you to go after larger, more difficult quarry.  And giving the meat away could give you
some useful things too -- better spots, more prestige, old tools, even political clout to open new seasons or change game laws.

You check your map.  Should you go somewhere else next time?  There's a whole world out there to explore, and plenty to try to hunt.
